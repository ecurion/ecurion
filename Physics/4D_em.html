      <h1> On the Fourth Dimensionality of Electromagnetism </h1>
<div class = "content">
      <h2> Abstract</h2>
      <p>
            This paper analyses a symmetry between electromagnetism and gravitation, and electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves. Considering the similarities, we propose a possibility for a new theory unifying electromagnetism and gravitation. Experiments to verify the proposed theory, and some implications are also discussed.
      </p>

      <h2>Prologue</h2>
      <p>
            We start by considering a one-dimensional string lying along the X-axis. A transversewave created on this string would propagate along X, in one-dimension. For such a one dimensional transverse wave, we see that the 1D space displaces into an other higher dimension as the wave propagates (fig1). Similarly, A water surface is a two dimensional space and ripples on this surface form a two dimensional transverse waves, with displacements into a third dimension. <br>
            Light, as we know it, is a disturbance in Electric and Magnetic vector-field that propagates in 3D space. The waves are transverse with \(\vec E\)   and \(\vec B\) perpendicular to the direction of propagation and the wave propagates in all three spacial dimensions. <br>
            It is quite rare for a wave to be transverse and propagate in three dimensions. Gravitational and electromagnetic waves are the only two we know of that show this property. Einsteins theory of General Relativity explains Gravity as the curvature of a four dimensional space-time, and gravitational waves as ripples in this 4D manifold. Thus, All the transverse waves we know of, except electromagnetic waves, require one extra dimension (one more than the dimension in which they propagate) for their existence. <br>

      <h2>Theory Proposed</h2>
      <p>
            The theory of electromagnetism shares a lot of similarities with Gravitation, from the force equations to the existence of waves. Considering the similarities between electromagnetism and gravity, and em-waves and gravitational waves, we propose that: <br><br>

            Along with three spacial \(\left(x,y,z\right)\) and one temporal \(t\) dimension, there exists another temporal dimension \(s\). <br><br>

            Electromagnetic Waves are ripples in this \(\left(\vec r, s, t\right)\) manifold and \(\vec E\) and \(\vec B\) are its percievable effects in 3D. <br><br>

            Electromagnetism is the result of curvature of this higher dimensional space and the curvature is caused by the presence of charge. Electric and Magnetic Fields are (Just like Gravitational Force) a consequence of this curvature. <br>
            It need not be the case that the s-dimension is affected only by charge. Charges and masses together distort the \(\left(\vec r, s, t\right)\) manifold, and this could mean a coexistence of gravitational and electromagnetic waves.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I think so</h2>
      <p>
            The fact that a transverse wave requires one extra dimension seems true for all waves we see in nature. em-waves and Gravitational waves are the only two transverse waves that propagate in three dimensions. Amoung the two, gravitational waves are disturbances in a 4D space-time. Since nature loves symmetry, em-waves may also be a disturbance in another higher dimension. <br><br>

            The theory of relativity has already unified electricity and magnetism as the same force observed from different frames of reference. The space-time manifold well explains the existence of electromagnetic forces, given the electromagnetic field tensor \(F_{\mu\nu}\). The elements of \(F_{\mu\nu}\) are related to the four vector \(A_{\mu}\), but we don’t know what causes \(A_{\mu}\) to exist. <br><br>
      </p>
      <p id = "ref1" style = "scroll-margin-top: 20vh;">
            This situation is very similar to the Newtonian picture of Gravity, just one dimension up. Newton’s theory well explains gravity in three dimensions given Gravitational force vector : <br>
            \[F^{\mu} = \frac{GMm}{\left(x^{\alpha}x_{\alpha}\right)^{3//2}}x^{\mu}\]

            But fails to explain the existence of \(F^{\mu}\). If Einstein's General theory can explain the origin of \(F^{\mu}\) as the curvature of a four dimensional manifold, We believe taht the existence of \(A_{\mu}\) can be explained as the curvature of a five dimensional \(\left(\vec r, s, t \right)\) manifold.
            
      </p>

      <h2>Hopeful Prospects of the theory</h2>
      <p>
            This hypothesis, if true, would explain electromagnetism and gravity under the same framework. This would unify two of the fundamental forces at-least partially, and take us a step closer to the theory of everything. <br><br> 

            It is a daily life observation that a floating ball would rise up as a water wave passes by. Its also known that objects with mass displace in space-time as a gravitational wave passes by. It is quite possible that matter which can interact with electromagnetic waves (like electrons) are displacing into this higher dimension during interaction. It can be hypothesised that the uncertainty in position is a result of such displacements. <br><br>

            In General Theory of Relativity, energy causes curvature of space-time. Since matter have rest-mass energies, they always curve space-time. However, charges in motion curve space-time but not charges at rest. If the hypothesised s-dimension exists, charges at rest would also curve the (⃗r, s, t) manifold and maintain the symmetry. We could also introduce a rest-charge-energy q0. <br><br>

            The speed of light in vacuum is a constant and the reason why it is constant is still a paradox. In case of other waves, speed depended on the properties of the medium of propagation but em-waves lacked such a medium. Understanding the properties of the proposed higher dimension may give an insight to ”why c ?”.

      </p>  

      <h2>Criticisms</h2>
      <p>
            The transverse nature of em-waves is different from the transverse nature of waves on string and water. Unlike other transverse waves we see in nature, the displacements involved in em-waves are not physical displacements. Electromagnetic waves travel in 3D but there is no physical displacement into a higher dimension. The displacements involved are \(\vec E\) and \(\vec B\), which are not physical and occur in their own E-space and B-space. <br>
            So it can be argued that the requirement of extra dimension is necessary only for water and string waves. <br><br>

            We would like to stress that a similar argument can also be made about gravitational waves, if Einstein had not discovered space-time curvature. From a Newtonian point of view, the displacement in Gravitational Waves is the gravitational field vector \(\vec F\), which is not physical and occur in its own space. <br>
            Our theory, just like Einsteins theory of Gravity, is eliminating the requirement of E-space and B-space. By predicting the existence of one more temporal dimension and explaining \(\vec E\) and \(\vec B\) as the perceivable effects of curvature into this higher dimension, we eliminate the requirement of fields.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
            Understanding our universe has always involved making some guess to begin with. Planck’s quantum hypothesis, Debroglie’s theory of matter waves, are all examples of such innovative guesses. This theory is nothing more than a symmetry argument which may not end up being true. But if it comes out to be true, it would literally open a whole new dimension for us to explore, and unify Gravity and Electromagnetism. <br>
            Being a graduate student, I am not talented enough to complete the mathematical formulations involved or to prove that Maxwell’s equations can be obtained from the proposed postulates. <br>
            I hope more researches would happen in this field giving us a unified theory of GEM. <br><br>

      <h2>Appendix 1 : Mathematical Attempt</h2>
      <p>
            In a weak field limit, Einstein's Field Equations simplify to Newton's Laws of Gravitation. Thus, by comparing the metric tensor \(g_{\mu\nu}\) of curved space-time with the Newton's Force equation, we can see how Force Vector \(F^{\mu}\) relates to curvature.<br><br>
            Now from the analogy mentioned <a href = "#ref1" >above</a>, the four-vector \(A^{\mu}\) should have a similar relationship with the five-dimensional curvature. <br><br>
